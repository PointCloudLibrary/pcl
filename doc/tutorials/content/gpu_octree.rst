Using GPU Octree search functions
====================================================

The GPU Octree sub-module provides  parallelized search operations using a CUDA Octree implementation. In this tutorial, we will learn how to utilize octrees to perform search queries on unorganized point clouds. In order to utilize GPU Octree functions, you must first build PCL with GPU support enabled, by following `these instructions <https://pcl-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gpu_install.html#gpu-install>`_.


When to use the GPU Octree module
=================================

The primary aim of the GPU octree module is to allow parallelized search functionality. This allows users to achieve a significant performance gain by utilizing the GPU octree implementation over the CPU implementation when a large number of queries must be carried out on a point cloud.

This module primarily provides implementations for the following three search methods.

- Radius search
- K Nearest Neighbors Search (currently restricted to k=1 only)
- Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search

In contrast to the their CPU counterparts, all of these functions accept a vector of queries rather than a single query. Apart from this, there are some minor differences between the CPU and GPU implementations, and these will be highlighted throughout this tutorial.

.. note::

    The above functions may give erroneous results in PCL versions < 1.12 due to warp synchronization errors. These errors have been fixed from PCL 1.12 upwards.

.. note::

    The API of the above three functions have been modified from PCL 1.12 onwards to return squared distances from query point to result points. The following tutorial is based on the modified API. You can reference the API of the GPU octree search methods `here <https://pointclouds.org/documentation/classpcl_1_1gpu_1_1_octree.html>`_.

The following table shows a sample comparison between the performance of the CPU and GPU implementations.


The code
========
First, create a file, letâ€™s say, gpu_octree_search.cpp and place the following code inside it:

.. literalinclude:: sources/gpu_octree/gpu_octree.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :linenos:

The Explanation
===============

Initially, we define and instantiate a PointCloud structure and fill it with random points. We also create some random queries.

.. literalinclude:: sources/gpu_octree/gpu_octree.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 22-45


Building an octree
------------------

Next we create an octree instance and build the octree. In order to do this, we must first create an instance of `pcl::gpu::Octree::PointCloud` using the points in our point cloud. In order to do this, we must first upload those points to the GPU. Here "upload" refers to copying data from host memory to GPU memory (Conversely, "download" refers to copying data from GPU memory to host memory). We will also upload our queries for later use.  For this, we must create a `pcl::gpu::Octree::Queries` object and upload query points to this object.

Note that unlike in the CPU octree implementation, the user cannot set the resolution of the octree. Instead, the depth of the octree will be automatically determined depending on the point distribution of the cloud (However, the maximum depth is capped at 10).

.. literalinclude:: sources/gpu_octree/gpu_octree.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 47-58

After building the octree, we we can move on to the different search queries.

K Nearest Neighbors search
---------------------------

The K nearest neighbor algorithm is designed to identify a given (k) number of nearest neighbors to a query point. However, the GPU KNN search algorithm is currently restricted to k=1 only.


.. note::

    The GPU K nearest neighbor algorithm differs from it's CPU counterpart in implementation. Specifically, the CPU algorithm will only find approximate nearest neighbors, where the user can set the upper bound of the error allowed. In contrast, the GPU algorithm finds the absolute nearest neighbor.

In order to perform K nearest search, we must prepare output buffers on the device to store the results of the search queries. Specifically, we need two separate buffers to store the resulting nearest neighbor indices and the corresponding squared distances between the search point and nearest neighbors. Note that these buffers will be automatically resized to `k * number of queries` size, in order to hold all the results.

Now, we can perform the K nearest neighbors search on GPU. After performing the search we must download the results from GPU memory into host memory using two new vectors for indices and square distances.


.. literalinclude:: sources/gpu_octree/gpu_octree.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 62-98

Radius Search
-------------

Radius search returns neighbors within a given radius to the query point. The user must specify a maximum limit of points to return per query. There are implementations radius search available which either return / do not return the corresponding squared distances to the query point. Note that the methods which do not return squared distances are more efficient than those that do. In usage, this works very similar to the K nearest neighbor search.

Neighbors are returned as a `pcl::gpu::NeighborIndices` object, which contains all result indices packed into a one dimensional vector called `data`, as well as an additional vector called `sizes` which contains the number of results found for each individual query. These sizes can can be used to split the resulting indices as well as square distances by query.

Radius search can be conducted with a single radius for all queries or, individual radii may be specified for each query, by passing a `pcl::gpu::Octree::Radiuses` object of the same size as the queries object to the radius search method. In this tutorial we will specify individual radii for each of our ten queries.

.. literalinclude:: sources/gpu_octree/gpu_octree.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :lines: 103-151


Approximate Nearest Search
--------------------------

As the name suggests, approximate nearest search differs from K nearest search by the fact that it's traversal mechanism is 'approximate'. Specifically, during traversal, it will attempt to identify the most likely leaf to hold the nearest neighbor using the 'distance from query point to voxel center' heuristic. Thus there is no guarantee that this method will find the absolute nearest neighbor, and in fact there is also no guarantee of an upper-bound of the error in the result.

Please note that the approximate nearest neighbor method may be deprecated in the future due to its similarity with the KNN search method.

Compiling and running the program

Add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file

.. literalinclude:: sources/gpu_octree/CMakeLists.txt

After you have made the executable, you can run it with::

  $ ./gpu_octree_search

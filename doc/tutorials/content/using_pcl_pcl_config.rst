Using PCL in your own project
-----------------------------

This tutorial explains how to use PCL in your own projects.


Prerequisites
-------------

We assume you have downloaded, compiled and installed PCL on your
machine.

Project settings
----------------
Let us say the project is placed under /PATH/TO/MY/GRAND/PROJECT that
contains a lonely cpp file name ``pcd_write.cpp`` (copy it from the
:ref:`writing_pcd` tutorial). In the same folder, create a file named 
CMakeLists.txt that contains:

.. code-block:: cmake
   
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6 FATAL_ERROR)
   project(MY_GRAND_PROJECT)
   find_package(PCL 1.3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS common io)
   include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
   add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})
   add_executable(pcd_write_test pcd_write.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(pcd_write_test ${PCL_COMMON_LIBRARIES} ${PCL_IO_LIBRARIES})

The explanation
---------------

Now, let's see what we did.

.. code-block:: cmake
   
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6 FATAL_ERROR)
   
This is mandatory for cmake, and since we are making very basic
project we don't need features from cmake 2.8 or higher.

.. code-block:: cmake
   
   project(MY_GRAND_PROJECT)  

This line names your project and sets some useful cmake variables
such as those to refer to the source directory
(MY_GRAND_PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR) and the directory from which you are
invoking cmake (MY_GRAND_PROJECT_BINARY_DIR).

.. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(PCL 1.3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS common io)

We are requesting to find the PCL package at minimum version 1.3. We
also says that it is ``REQUIRED`` meaning that cmake will fail
gracefully if it can't be found. As PCL is modular one can request:

* only one component: find_package(PCL 1.3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS io)
* several: find_package(PCL 1.3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS io common)
* all existing: find_package(PCL 1.3 REQUIRED)

.. code-block:: cmake

   include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
   add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})
   
When PCL is found, several related variables are set:

* `PCL_FOUND`: set to 1 if PCL is found, otherwise unset
* `PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS`: set to the paths to PCL installed headers and
  the dependency headers
* `PCL_LIBRARIES`: set to the file names of the built and installed PCL libraries
* `PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS`: set to the paths to where PCL libraries and 3rd
  party dependencies reside
* `PCL_VERSION`: the version of the found PCL 
* `PCL_COMPONENTS`: lists all available components
* `PCL_DEFINITIONS`: lists the needed preprocessor definitions and compiler flags

To let cmake know about external headers you include in your project,
one needs to use ``include_directories()`` macro. In our case
``PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS``, contains exactly what we need, thus we ask cmake
to search the paths it contains for a header potentially included.

.. code-block:: cmake

   add_executable(pcd_write_test pcd_write.cpp)

Here, we tell cmake that we are trying to make an executable file
named ``pcd_write_test`` from one single source file
``pcd_write.cpp``. CMake will take care of the suffix (``.exe`` on
Windows platform and blank on UNIX) and the permissions.

.. code-block:: cmake

   target_link_libraries(pcd_write_test ${PCL_COMMON_LIBRARIES} ${PCL_IO_LIBRARIES})

The executable we are building makes call to PCL functions. So far, we
have only included the PCL headers so the compilers knows about the
methods we are calling. We need also to make the linker knows about
the libraries we are linking against. As said before the, PCL
found libraries are referred to using ``PCL_LIBRARIES`` variable, all
that remains is to trigger the link operation which we do calling
``target_link_libraries()`` macro.
PCLConfig.cmake uses a CMake special feature named `EXPORT` which
allows for using others' projects targets as if you built them
yourself. When you are using such targets they are called `imported
targets` and acts just like any other target.

Compiling and running the project
---------------------------------

Using command line CMake
========================

Make a directory called ``build``, in which the compilation will be
done. Do::

  $ cd /PATH/TO/MY/GRAND/PROJECT
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..

You will see something similar to::

-- The C compiler identification is GNU
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc -- works
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++
-- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
-- Found PCL_IO: /usr/local/lib/libpcl_io.so
-- Found PCL: /usr/local/lib/libpcl_io.so (Required is at least version "1.0")
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /PATH/TO/MY/GRAND/PROJECT/build

If you want to see what is written on the CMake cache::

 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /usr/local
 PCL_DIR                          /usr/local/share/pcl

Now, we can build up our project, simply typing::

  $ make

The result should be as follow::

  Scanning dependencies of target pcd_write_test
  [100%] Building CXX object
  CMakeFiles/pcd_write_test.dir/pcd_write.cpp.o
  Linking CXX executable pcd_write_test
  [100%] Built target pcd_write_test

The project is now compiled, linked and ready to test::

  $ ./pcd_write_test


Which leads to this::

  Saved 5 data points to test_pcd.pcd.
    0.352222 -0.151883 -0.106395
    -0.397406 -0.473106 0.292602
    -0.731898 0.667105 0.441304
    -0.734766 0.854581 -0.0361733
    -0.4607 -0.277468 -0.916762

Using CMake gui (e.g. Windows)
==============================

Run CMake GUI, and fill these fields :

  - ``Where is the source code`` : this is the folder containing the CMakeLists.txt file and the sources.
  - ``Where to build the binaries`` : this is where the Visual Studio project files will be generated
  
Then, click ``Configure``. You will be prompted for a generator/compiler. Then click the ``Generate``
button. If there is no errors, the project files will be generated into the ``Where to build the binaries``
folder.

Open the sln file, and build your project!

Weird installations
-------------------
CMake has a list of default searchable paths where it seeks for
FindXXX.cmake or XXXConfig.cmake. If you happen to install in some non
obvious repository (let us say in `Documents` for evils) then you can
help cmake find PCLConfig.cmake adding this line:

.. code-block:: cmake

   set(PCL_DIR "/path/to/PCLConfig.cmake")

before this one:

.. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(PCL 1.3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS common io)
     ...

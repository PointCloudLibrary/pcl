Building PCL's dependencies from source on Windows
--------------------------------------------------

This tutorial explains how to build the Point Cloud Library needed dependencies **from source** on
Microsoft Windows platforms, and tries to guide you through the download and
the compilation process. As an example, we will be building the sources with Microsoft Visual Studio
2008 to get 32bit libraries. The procedure is almost the same for other compilers and for 64bit libraries. 

    .. note::
  
      Don't forget that all the dependencies must be compiled using the same
      compiler options and architecture specifications, i.e. you can't mix 32 bit
      libraries with 64 bit libraries.

Requirements
-------------

In order to compile every component of the PCL library we need to download and
compile a series of 3rd party library dependencies:

    - **Boost** version >= 1.46.1 (http://www.boost.org/)

    used for shared pointers, and threading. **mandatory**

    - **Eigen** version >= 3.0.0 (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

    used as the matrix backend for SSE optimized math. **mandatory**

    - **FLANN** version >= 1.6.8 (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/)

    used in `kdtree` for fast approximate nearest neighbors search. **mandatory**

    - **Visualization ToolKit (VTK)** version >= 5.6.1 (http://www.vtk.org/)

    used in `visualization` for 3D point cloud rendering and visualization. **mandatory**

    - **googletest** version >= 1.6.0 (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)

    used to build test units. **optional**

    - **QHULL** version >= 2011.1 (http://www.qhull.org/)

    used for convex/concave hull decompositions in `surface`. **optional**

    - **OpenNI** version >= 1.1.0.25 (http://www.openni.org/)

    used to grab point clouds from OpenNI compliant devices. **optional**

    - **Qt** version >= 4.6 (http://qt.digia.com/)

    used for developing applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) **optional**

.. note::
  
   Though not a dependency per se, don't forget that you also need the CMake
   build system (http://www.cmake.org/), at least version **2.8.3**. A Git
   client for Windows is also required to download the PCL source code.
   
Building dependencies
---------------------
In this tutorial, we'll be compiling these libraries versions::

    Boost : 1.48.0
    Flann : 1.7.1
    Qhull : 2011.1
    Qt    : 4.8.0
    VTK   : 5.8.0
    GTest : 1.6.0

Let's unpack all our libraries in C:/PCL_dependencies so that it would like
like::

    C:/PCL_dependencies
    C:/PCL_dependencies/boost-cmake
    C:/PCL_dependencies/eigen
    C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.7.1-src
    C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0
    C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull
    C:/PCL_dependencies/VTK

- **Boost** : 
    
    Let's start with `Boost`. We will be using the `CMake-able Boost` project which provide a CMake based build system
    for Boost. 
    
    To build Boost, open the CMake-gui and fill in the fields::
    
        Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/boost-cmake
        Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/boost-cmake/build

    Before clicking on "Configure", click on "Add Entry" button in the top right of CMake gui, in 
    the popup window, fill the fields as follows::

        Name  : LIBPREFIX
        Type  : STRING       
        Value : lib

    .. note::
    
       If you are using **Visual Studio 2010**, then add also these 3 CMake entries before clicking "Configure"::
         
         Name  : BOOST_TOOLSET
         Type  : STRING       
         Value : vc100              

         Name  : BOOST_COMPILER
         Type  : STRING       
         Value : msvc              

         Name  : BOOST_COMPILER_VERSION
         Type  : STRING       
         Value : 10.0              

    Hit the "Configure" button and CMake will tell that the binaries folder doesn't exist yet 
    (e.g., *C:/PCL_dependencies/boost-cmake/build*) and it will ask for a confirmation.
  
    Proceed and be sure to choose the correct "Generator" on the next window. So, we choose "Visual Studio 9 2008" 
    generator.
    
    .. image:: images/cmake_cminpack_3.png
       :alt: CMake generator selection
       :align: center  

    .. note::
    
       If you want to build 64 bit libraries, then choose "Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64" as generator.
    
    By default, all of the Boost modules will be built. If you want to build only the required modules for PCL, 
    then fill the **BUILD_PROJECTS** CMake entry (which is set to `ALL` by default) with a semicolon-seperated 
    list of boost modules::
    
      BUILD_PROJECTS : system;filesystem;date_time;thread;iostreams;tr1;serialization
      
    Also, uncheck the **ENABLE_STATIC_RUNTIME** checkbox. Then, click "Configure" again. If you get some 
    errors related to Python, then uncheck **WITH_PYTHON** checkbox, and click "Configure" again. 
    Now, in the CMake log, you should see something like::
    
      Reading boost project directories (per BUILD_PROJECTS) 
      
      + date_time
      + thread
      + serialization
      + system
      + filesystem
      +-- optional python bindings disabled since PYTHON_FOUND is false. 
      + tr1

    Now, click "Generate". A Visual Studio solution file will be generated inside the build folder 
    (e.g. C:/PCL_dependencies/boost-cmake/build). Open the `Boost.sln` file, then right click on 
    `INSTALL` project and choose `Build`. The `INSTALL`project will trigger the build of all the projects 
    in the solution file, and then will install the build libraries along with the header files to the default
    installation folder (e.g. C:/Program Files (x86)/Boost).
    
    .. note::
  
      If you get some errors during the installation process, it could be caused by the UAC of MS Windows
      Vista or Seven. To fix this, close Visual Studio, right click on its icon on the Desktop or in the Start Menu, 
      and choose "Run as administrator". Then Open the `Boost.sln` file, and build the **INSTALL** project.

- **Eigen** : 

    Eigen is a headers only library, so you can use the Eigen installer provided on the 
    `downloads page <http://www.pointclouds.org/downloads/windows.html>`_.


- **Flann** : 
    
    Let's move on to `FLANN`. Then open CMake-gui and fill in the fields::

        Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.7.1-src
        Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.7.1-src/build

    Hit the "Configure" button. Proceed and be sure to choose the correct "Generator" on the next window. 
    You can safely ignore any warning message about hdf5.    

    Now, on my machine I had to manually set the `BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS`
    and `BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS` to OFF otherwise it would not continue to the next
    step as it is complaining about unable to find Python and Matlab. Click on
    "Advanced mode" and find them, or alternatively, add those entries by clicking
    on the "Add Entry" button in the top right of the CMake-gui window.  Add one
    entry named "BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS", set its type to "Bool" and its value to
    unchecked. Do the same with the "BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS" entry. 

    Now hit the "Configure" button and it should work. Go for the "Generate" This will generate
    the required project files/makefiles to build the library. Now you can simply
    go to `C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.7.1-src/build` and proceed with the compilation using
    your toolchain. In case you use Visual Studio, you will find the Visual Studio
    Solution file in that folder.

    Build the **INSTALL** project in **release** mode.

    .. note::
  
      If you don't have a Python interpreter installed CMake would probably not allow you
      to generate the project files. To solve this problem you can install the Python interpreter
      (https://www.python.org/download/windows/) or comment the `add_subdirectory( test )` line 
      from C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.7.1-src/CMakeLists.txt .

- **QHull** : 

    Setup the CMake fields with the `qhull` paths::

      Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull-2011.1
      Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull-2011.1/build
      
    Before clicking on "Configure", click on "Add Entry" button in the top right of CMake gui, in 
    the popup window, fill the fields as follows::

      Name  : CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
      Type  : STRING       
      Value : _d
    
    Then click "Ok". This entry will define a postfix to distinguish between debug and release 
    libraries.    
    
    Then hit "Configure" twice and "Generate". Then build the **INSTALL** project, both in 
    **debug** and **release** configuration.

- **VTK** : 

    .. note::

      If you want to build PCL GUI tools, you need to build VTK with Qt support, so obviously, you need to build/install Qt before VTK.

    To configure Qt, we need to have Perl installed on your system. If it is not, just download and install it from http://strawberryperl.com.
    
    To build Qt from sources, download the source archive from Qt website. Unpack it some where on your disk (C:\\Qt\\4.8.0 e.g. for Qt 4.8.0).
    Then open a `Visual Studio Command Prompt` :

    Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Visual Studio 20XX**, point to **Visual Studio Tools**, 
    and then click **Visual Studio Command Prompt** if you are building in 32bit, or **Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt** 
    if you are building in 64bit.  

    In the command prompt, **cd** to Qt directory::

      prompt> cd c:\Qt\4.8.0
    
    We configure a minimal build of Qt using the Open Source licence. If you need a custom build, adjust the options as needed::

      prompt> configure -opensource -confirm-license -fast -debug-and-release -nomake examples -nomake demos -no-qt3support -no-xmlpatterns -no-multimedia -no-phonon -no-accessibility -no-openvg -no-webkit -no-script -no-scripttools -no-dbus -no-declarative
    
    Now, let's build Qt::

      prompt> nmake
    
    Now, we can clear all the intermediate files to free some disk space::

      prompt> nmake clean

    We're done with Qt! But before building VTK, we need to set an environment variable::

      QtDir = C:\Qt\4.8.0
  
    and then, append `%QtDir%\\bin` to your PATH environment variable.

    Now, configure VTK using CMake (make sure to restart CMake after setting the environment variables). 
    First, setup the CMake fields with the `VTK` paths, e.g.::

      Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/VTK
      Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/VTK/bin32
  
    Then hit "Configure". Check this checkbox and click "Configure"::

      VTK_USE_QT
    
    Make sure CMake did find Qt by looking at `QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE` CMake entry. If not, set it to the path of `qmake.exe`, 
    e.g. `C:\\Qt\\4.8.0\\bin\\qmake.exe`, then click "Configure".

    If Qt is found, then check this checkbox and click "Configure"::

      VTK_USE_QVTK_QTOPENGL

    Then, click "Generate", open the generated solution file, and build it in debug and release.

    That's it, we're done with the dependencies!

- **GTest** : 
      
    In case you want PCL tests (not recommended for users), you need to compile the `googletest` library (GTest). 
    Setup the CMake fields as usual::

      Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0
      Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0/bin32

    Hit "Configure" and set the following options::

     BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                OFF
     gtest_force_shared_crt           ON
 
    Generate and build the resulting project.
    
   
Building PCL
------------

Now that you built and installed PCL dependencies, you can follow the ":ref:`compiling_pcl_windows`" tutorial 
to build PCL itself.

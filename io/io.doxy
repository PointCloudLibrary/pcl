  \section secIoPresentation Overview
  
  The \b pcl_io library contains classes and functions for reading and writing
  point cloud data (PCD) files, as well as capturing point clouds from a
  variety of sensing devices. An introduction to some of these capabilities can
  be found in the following tutorials:

	- <a href="http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php#pcd-file-format">The PCD (Point Cloud Data) file format</a>
	- <a href="http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/reading_pcd.php#reading-pcd">Reading PointCloud data from PCD files</a>
	- <a href="http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/writing_pcd.php#writing-pcd">Writing PointCloud data to PCD files</a>
	- <a href="http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/openni_grabber.php#openni-grabber">The OpenNI Grabber Framework in PCL</a>
	
  PCL is agnostic with respect to the data sources that are used to generate 3D
  point clouds. While OpenNI-compatible cameras have recently been at the
  center of attention in the 3D/robotics sensing community, many of the devices
  enumerated below have been used with PCL tools in the past:

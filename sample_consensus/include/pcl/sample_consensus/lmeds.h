  /** \brief @b LeastMedianSquares represents an implementation of the LMedS (Least Median of Squares) algorithm. LMedS 
    * is a RANSAC-like model-fitting algorithm that can tolerate up to 50% outliers without requiring thresholds to be 
    * set. See Andrea Fusiello's "Elements of Geometric Computer Vision"
    * (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/FUSIELLO4/tutorial.html#x1-520007) for more details.
    * In contrast to RANSAC, LMedS does not divide the points into inliers and outliers when finding the model. Instead,
    * it uses the median of all point-model distances as the measure of how good a model is. A threshold is only needed
    * at the end, when it is determined which points belong to the found model.

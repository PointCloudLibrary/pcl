  /** \brief SampleConsensusModelParallelLine defines a model for 3D line segmentation using additional angular
    * constraints.
    *
    * Checking for inliers will not only involve a "distance to model" criterion, but also an additional "maximum
    * angular deviation" between the line's direction and a user-specified axis.
    *
    * The model coefficients are defined as:
    *   - \b point_on_line.x  : the X coordinate of a point on the line
    *   - \b point_on_line.y  : the Y coordinate of a point on the line
    *   - \b point_on_line.z  : the Z coordinate of a point on the line
    *   - \b line_direction.x : the X coordinate of a line's direction
    *   - \b line_direction.y : the Y coordinate of a line's direction
    *   - \b line_direction.z : the Z coordinate of a line's direction

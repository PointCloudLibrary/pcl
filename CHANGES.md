# ChangeList

## = 1.11.0 (11.05.2020) =

Starting with PCL 1.11, PCL uses `std::shared_ptr` and `std::weak_ptr` instead of the
boost smart pointers. The change leverages type aliases included with the 1.10.0
release. PCL 1.11 also introduces `pcl::index_t` which should be used for the size
of point types instead of `int`, `std::size_t`, etc. EOL for deprecated features
is also explicitly mentioned in the deprecation compile time warnings

## *= 1.10.0 (19.01.2020) =*

Starting with PCL 1.10, to ensure compatibility with future PCL releases, please
use `pcl::make_shared` and the `Class::Ptr` + `Class::ConstPtr` type-alias
instead of using direct names like `{boost, std}::shared_ptr` or `{boost,
std}::make_shared`.  There is also `pcl::shared_ptr` which offers the same
abstraction for non-PCL types.

* Correct overlapping grid distribution in 2D NDT implementation


## *= 1.5.0 (2012-02-22) = :: "Better late than never" =*

The most notable overall changes are:

* new framework for PCL examples in the example/ folder
* added the ICCV 2011 tutorial code to the list of bundled applications
* a brand new PCL tracking library (`libpcl_tracking`)
* new, well-tested implementations for `OrganizedNeighbor` and `BruteForceSearch` in `libpcl_search`
* considerable speedups for: eigendecomposition, covariance matrix estimation, and normal estimation (now running at 30Hz on VGA data)
* a lot of bug fixes and code refactorizations and optimizations (thanks to everyone that contributed!)
* compilation now defaults to Eigen column major again, but all the code in PCL should compile and work against both row major and column major matrices.
* libpcl_range_image is now incorporated into pcl_common, no extra linking required.

### `libpcl_common`

* added two new methods to compute centroid and covariance at once. Both are faster than calculating first the centroid and afterwards the covariance matrix. The float versions of the new methods are twice as fast but less accurate, whereas the double versions are more accurate and about 35% faster.
* fixed a few issues in our ScopeTime class where the creation of the string as well as the cerr were contributing negatively to the time measurements
* added empty() to PointCloud<Eigen::MatrixXf> to return whether the matrix is empty or not
* added size to PointCloud<Eigen::MatrixXf> and fixed the constructor warnings exposed by -pedantic
* added two new Point Types: Axis and ReferenceFrame as they are used in the Reference Frame calculations
* added a helper functor (`CopyIfFieldExists`) for copying out specific data out of a PointT field. See `test_common.cpp` for usage examples
* implemented and tested a fix for feature request #558: Implement IO for PointCloud<MatrixXf>


### `libpcl_filters`

* refactored RandomSample to return sorted indices. In addition it now runs nearly twice as fast at it did previously.
* fixed and implemented feature #518: VoxelGrid<> performance improvement (roughly 50+ times)

### `libpcl_kdtree`

* removed unneeded mutices, added asserts instead of constant checks (the user is responsible for passing in valid data!) and sped up a few other things in KDTreeFLANN

### `libpcl_search`

* adapted use of flann::Matrix to new semantics of the 'stride' parameter, fixing incorrect results and a crash in FlannSearch
* changes that affect pcl_features, pcl_search, pcl_octree, pcl_registration, pcl_surface:

   * we used to have 3 "overloads" for nearestKSearch and 3 for radiusSearch that every class inheriting from pclk::KdTree or pcl::search::Search needed to implement. Because most of the children always had the same implementation (copy&paste) we moved it up in the base class, made the methods virtual, and only children that need to change that behavior will overwrite it.
   * the max_nn parameter from radiusSearch has been changed from int with a default value of -1 to an unsigned int with a default value of 0. Each radiusSearch implementation should check for 0 or >= max_points_in_cloud and branch accordingly (if needed).
   * const correctness is now implemented everywhere in all nearestKSearch and radiusSearch operations

* added an implementation of KdTreeFLANN for PointCloud<Eigen::MatrixXf> data structures
* FlannSearch: don't include flann/matrix.h, move all FLANN includes to impl/flann_search.hpp. Also adapt max_nn parameter in radius search to change r3962 (pass 0 to search for all neighbors instead of -1)
* completely new and shiny `BruteForceSearch` and `OrganizedNeighbor` classes


### `libpcl_octree`

* fixed issue #513 (bug in octree iterator)
* fixed octree bounding box adaption
* fixed range test in getPointByIndex method (octree)
* fixed bug #604 & removed compiler warnings in Visual Studio 10
* fixed numerical problem in octree pointcloud class when points lie very close to the bounding box bounds
* improved performance with std::deque in OctreeBreadthFirstIterator class
* added breadth-first octree iterator and depth-first octree iterator classes, restructured octree iterator classes, moved "getVoxelBounds" method from OctreeIterator class to OctreePointCloud class


### `libpcl_sample_consensus`

* added explicit checks + errors for NaN covariance matrices
* fixed a crash on 32bit platforms (thanks bharath)
* fix for #498: Bug in setOptimizeCoefficients for pcl::SACMODEL_SPHERE. The issue actually exposed a grave bug introduced with r2755, when we switched from CMinPack to Eigen. The fix touches all segmentation models in pcl_sample_consensus using Levenberg-Marquardt, and TransformationEstimationLM in libpcl_registration. Also added unit test to catch this in the future.

### `libpcl_io`

* fix row-major/column-major issues in I/O (#578 related)
* fixed #593 by removing unimplemented method declarations
* added a `saveVTKFile` method helper for saving `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2` data
* added support for reading PCD ascii and binary files (binary_compressed not implemented yet!) for pcl::PointCloud<Eigen::MatrixXf> datatypes.
* implemented and tested a fix for feature request #558: Implement IO for PointCloud<MatrixXf>
* added `PointXYZRGBA` callbacks for `OpenNIGrabber` and `PCLVisualizer`
* fixed issue #565
* fixed a few bugs in PCDReader regarding uint8/int8 data values and added a comprehensive unit test for all possible combinations of data types that we support in PCL
* added isValueFinite for checking whether a value T is finite or not, and rewrote the PCDReader bits of code that perform the is_dense checks
* integrated libply written by Ares Lagae as an independent component in io
* rely on ply library for PLY parsing, remove the old parser and use the freshly integrated libply, change the namespace ::ply to ::pcl::io::ply to avoid any potential issue


### `libpcl_surface`

* Updated convex hull.  It should now be somewhat faster, and allows users to optionally specify if the input is 2D or 3D, so the input dimension need not be calculated every time.
* fix for #562: pcl::ConcaveHull crashes on an empty cloud (thanks Mourad!)
* added option to ensure that triangle vertices are ordered in the positive direction around the normals in GreedyProjectionTriangulation
* fixed issue #489 in GreedyProjectionTriangulation
* fixed triangle vertex ordering issues in OrganizedFastMesh
* MarchingCubes now adheres to the new pcl_surface base class architecture
* added PCLSurfaceBase base class for MeshConstruction and SurfaceReconstruction, to unify the API around setSearchMethod(&Search) and reconstruct(&PolygonMesh)
* added marching_cubes_reconstruction tool

### `libpcl_features`

* fixed issue #550: Uninformative error in VFHEstimation (thanks David!)
* fix for #504: Make ShapeContext and SpinImage uniform (thanks David!). Note: this is an API breaking change, as `setInputCloudWithNormals`, which was deviating from the `FeatureEstimation` API is now replaced with patched `setInputCloud` and `setInputNormals`, thus no longer causing an error. However, we are confident with this change as the API was broken, so this is a bug fix.
* fixed a bug in the `PointCloud<MatrixXf>` feature estimation and I/O regarding the fields `count` property
* fixed an issue where the header stamp should only be copied from a PointCloud<T> into a PointCloud<MatrixXf> in PCL standalone, and not in PCL in ROS
* optimized RSD computation
* speeded up normal estimation in IntegralImageNormalEstimation
* renamed computeFeature (MatrixXf&) into computeFeatureEigen (MatrixXf&) and compute (MatrixXf&) into computeEigen (MatrixXf&) to keep the compiler happy, avoid multiple inheritance, and use clearer semantics between the two different output estimation methods
* fixed an issue where if radius would be defined for VFHEstimation, Feature::initCompute would error out
* fixed issue #539 (fpfh_estimation tutorial)
* fixed issue #544 (overflow in implicit constant conversion warnings)
* fixed issue #527 (bug in IntegralImageNormalEstimation)
* fixed issue #514 (SpinImages segfault when using setKSearch)

### `libpcl_registration`

* added TransformationValidation base class and TransformationValidationEuclidean as a measure to validate whether a final transformation obtained via TransformationEstimation when registering a pair of clouds was correct or not
* added getter/setter for maximum number of inner iterations to control number of optimizations in GeneralizedIterativeClosestPoint
* fixed issue #507
* fixed issue #533 (WarpPointRigid missing EIGEN_MAKE_ALIGNED_OPERATOR_NEW)
* fixed issue #464 (already defined function pointers)
* fixed a grave bug on 32bit architectures where MapAligned was used incorrectly

### `libpcl_segmentation`

* fixed a segmentation fault in SACSegmentationFromNormals caused by calling segment without passing the input XYZ or normal data
* added a missing `setDistanceFromOrigin` to `SACSegmentationFromNormals` for `SACMODEL_NORMAL_PARALLEL_PLANE` (thanks A. Barral)

### `libpcl_visualization`

* added `PointXYZRGBA` callbacks for `OpenNIGrabber` and `PCLVisualizer`
* fixed two bugs where a segfault would occur in `addPolygonMesh` when the input cloud would be empty, as well as #563 : PCLVisualizer::addPolygonMesh crash (thanks Mourad!)
* added the capability to remove a cloud when `removeShape` is called, to preserve API backward compatibility (a `PolygonMesh` is not treated as a `CloudActor` inside `PCLVisualizer`)
* fix #472: at startup the camera view pointis set to last added point cloud, but with the key combination ALT+r on can iterate through the view points of the visualized point clouds.
* added `addPointCloud` method for `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2` data (useful to bypass the conversion to XYZ for `pcd_viewer`)
* added `PCL_VISUALIZER_IMMEDIATE_RENDERING` for processing large datasets
* refactorized `pcd_viewer` to consume less memory by skipping the intermediate conversion to `PointCloud<PointXYZ>`, clearing the `PointCloud2` data once converted to VTK, and enabling intermediate mode
* added `setPosition` to `pcl::visualization::ImageViewer` for allowing the image viewer to be moved somewhere else on screen
* changed the `openni_image` viewer tool to display both RGB and depth images
* fixed a nasty bug where the scalars range were not correctly updated in the mapper on updatePointCloud thus causing weird VTK warnings at the console
* added setupInteractor to allow QVTK customizations
* pcd_grabber_viewer now shows the recorded images in PointXYZRGB clouds, and can use fps=0 and trigger each new frame manually by pressing SPACE
* fixed an BGR/RGB issue in image_viewer
* added setKeyboardModifier to change the default keyboard modifier from Alt to Shift or Ctrl so that in QVTK or other widgets, we can still use shortcuts like Mod+r, Mod+f, etc
* PCLVisualizer is now working with VTK compiled for cocoa, no X11 necessary on OS X
* build bundle executable for pcd_viewer if VTK is compiled with Cocoa. With that the keyboard events are handled by the application
* modified openni_passthrough to use QVTK instead of VTK
* added PCLVisualizer zoom in/out via /- [ alt]
* implemented feature #516 (pcd_viewer multiview with .vtk files)
* added showMonoImage for displaying a monochrome unsigned char 2D image in PCLVisualizer
* added setFullScreen and setWindowBorders methods to allow an user to change the full screen/border properties of the PCLVisualizer GUI
* fix for issue #519 (set the minimum number of cloud points to 1 in vtkLODActor)
* fix for issue #524 (ctrl problem with pcd_viewer)
* fix for issue #532 (PCLVizualizer::addCoordinateSystem() switch from Eigen::Matrix4f to Eigen::Affine3f)
* bug fix in pcd_grabber_viewer: now sorting the read .pcd file by name before showing them (was in random order before)
* fixed issue #525 (pcd_viewer did not handle nan values correctly in fields other than x, y, z)
* fixed a bug where changing the point color using setPointCloudRenderingProperties would not update the actor's colors on screen
* workaround for displaying FPS rate on PCLVisualizer - disabled backface culling because of known VTK issue

## *= 1.4.0 (2011-12-31) = :: "Happy New Year" =*

The most notable overall changes are:

* changed the default on the order of data in all Eigen matrices to be **row major** `-DEIGEN_DEFAULT_TO_ROW_MAJOR` (Eigen defaults to column major). Be careful if your code was using 1D index operators, as they might be broken! See http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicStorageOrders.html and http://listengine.tuxfamily.org/lists.tuxfamily.org/eigen/2011/12/msg00062.html.

### `libpcl_common`

* added float union to the pointXYZRGBL type, in order to aid PCD_viewer compatibility
* bugfix: `pcl::computeCovarianceMatrixNormalized` did not normalize for each implementation
* fixed bug #421: `at(u,v)` should return a const reference
* added `InitFailedException` and `UnorganizedPointCloudException`. Created `PCL_EXCEPTION` helper macro
* added the GFPFH global descriptor point type
* added gaussian kernel class and utilities
* added `isTrivial` to `pcl::PointRepresentation` which allows avoiding copy operations in special cases, thus speeding up operations like `rep->isValid (p)`
* added `eigen33` for smallest eigenvalue/vector and only eigenvalues version
* added `PointCloudColorHandlerHSVField` implementation
* deleted wrong definition of density in `pcl::transformPointCloud`
* added copy constructor for PCLBase
* fixed `PointCloud`'s in range inserter: width and height were not updated
* added `PCL_MAJOR_VERSION` and `PCL_MINOR_VERSION` #defines per Ryan's request
* fixed the `getMatrixXf` advanced user API call to return the correct values now that we are forcing Eigen Matrices to be row major in 1.x
* moved the content of `win32_macros.h` into `pcl_macros.h`
* added an `isFinite` method to check for x/y/z = NaN in point_types.hpp
* moved internal headers from `pcl/ros/point_traits.h` into `pcl/point_traits.h` and `pcl/ros/for_each_type.h` to `pcl/for_each_type.h` (these headers are for internal use only and should have never been imported by user code - however pcl_ros in perception_pcl_unstable will need to be modified when following trunk after this revision, as that is the only external piece of code that should import these headers)
* fixed one of the constructors for `pcl::PointCloud<T> (cloud, indices)` that was incomplete
* no longer checking "frame_id" parameters in header for operator += in `pcl::PointCloud<T>`
* added operator + for `pcl::PointCloud<T>`
* improved doxygen documentation all around `libpcl_common`
* added new specialization for `pcl::PointCloud<Eigen::MatrixXf>` - for *advanced users only*! (expect the API to change in trunk if needed)
* moved `NdCopyPointEigenFunctor` and `NdCopyEigenPointFunctor` from `voxel_grid.h` to `point_cloud.h`
* added `CloudProperties` class for optional properties for `pcl::PointCloud<Eigen::MatrixXf>`, and moved `sensor_origin_` and `sensor_orientation_` there (as `properties.sensor_origin` and `properties.sensor_orientation`), and removed `header`, while keeping `header.stamp` as `properties.acquisition_time`
* fixed the copy constructor (vector<size_t> -> vector<int>) and added an implementation for the + operator
* added a general convolution class. Convolution handles point cloud convolution in rows, columns and horizontal directions. Convolution allows for 3 policies: zero padding (default), borders mirroring and borders duplicating through `PointCloudSpring` class
* refactorized `PointCorrespondence` and `Correspondence` into the same thing, per issue #458
* added `ChannelProperties` in preparation for 2.0
* fixed bug #445: Overloaded the setIndices method in PCLBase so that it can accept `boost::shared_ptr<const std::vector> >`
* disabled unit test for `getMatrixXfMap` in DEBUG mode, as it was failing due to eigen's strictness on aligned/unaligned data, and added const+non consts versions

### `libpcl_filters`

* fixed bug in `random_sample.cpp`; The `PointCloud2` filter wasn't working causing the unit test to fail
* crop_box filter now supports `PointT` and `PointCloud2` point clouds
* added a normal space sampling filter
* fixed bug #433: `pcl::CropBox` doesn't update `width` and `height` member of output point cloud
* fixed bug #423 `CropBox` + `VoxelGrid` filters, order changes behaviour (using openni grabber)
* add `CropHull` filter for filtering points based on a 2D or 3D convex or concave hull. The ray-polygon intersection test is used, which relies on closed polygons/surfaces
* added clipper3D interface and a draft plane_clipper3D implementation
* removed spurious old `ColorFilter` class (obsolete, and it was never implemented - the skeleton was just lurking around)
* better Doxygen documentation to `PassThrough`, `VoxelGrid` and `Filter`
* moved the `set/getFilterLimits`, `set/getFilterFieldName`, and `get/setFilterLimitsNegative` from `Filter` into `VoxelGrid` and `PassThrough`, as they were the only filters using it. The rest were not, thus leading to user confusion and a bloated API.

### `libpcl_kdtree`

* fixed bug #442: reversed template parameters preventing use of nearestKSearchT and radiusSearchT in `pcl::search::Search` and `pcl::kdtree:KdTree`

### `libpcl_search`

* fixed a bug in `OrganizedNeighbor` where one of the `radiusSearch` signatures was working only if the cloud is _not_ organized (#420 - thanks Hanno!)
* updated `pcl::search:OrganizedNeighbor` to be back functional, radiusSearch is working back, 4-6x faster then KdTree, Knearest still need to implement this
* changed `pcl::search::FlannSearch`: fixed style of class and tests, moved impl to hpp
* cleaning up `OrganizedNearestNeighbor` as well as implementing one of the missing `radiusSearch` methods
* improved documentation for libpcl_search and silenced all Doxygen warnings
* removed auto (it needs to be completely rewritten and was left in a very bad state)
* made sure all the output of the search method is consistently returning 0 in case the nearest neighbor search failed and not -1
* updated kdtree wrapper code for the latest FLANN release

### `libpcl_octree`

* replaced rand () with boost random number generators and fixed all failing unit tests
* workaround to get rid of infinite loops if no valid model could be found

### `libpcl_io`

* refactorization and consistent code indentation + make sure the timestamp is not set if we use PCL in ROS
* fixed an older issue where the `is_dense` flag was not set appropriately when reading data from a binary file (thanks Updog!)
* fixed an issue in the `PLYWriter` class where the element camera was not correctly set thus leading to crashes in Meshlab (thanks Bruno!)
* the VTK library loads vertex colors in PLY files as RGB. Added that to the polymesh loader.
* fixed 2 bugs in writing `PolygonMesh` and unpacking RGB

* fix: rgb values need to be packed before saving them in PointCloud2 for `PLYWriter`
* added example code for accessing synchronized image x depth data
* added support for the Stanford range_grid element and obj_info for PLY files. If you chosse to use range_grid instead of camera then only valid vertices will be written down to the PLY file.

### `lipcl_keypoints`

* added refine method for `Harris3D` corner detector
* rewrote big parts of the NARF keypoint extraction. Hopefully fixing some stability issues. Unfortunately still pretty slow for high resolution point clouds.
* fixed bug #461 (SIFT Keypoint result cloud fields not complete); cleaned up the line-wrapping in the error/warning messages

### `libpcl_surface`

* fixed a bug in `MarchingCubes`'s `getIndexIn1D` which led to the result variable to overflow when the data_size was larger than something around 2^10 (thanks Robert!)
* reviewed and slightly modified mls implementation. Added `MovingLeastSquaresOMP` OpenMP implementation
* new architecture for the mesh processing algorithms using VTK: `MeshProcessing`
* overloaded `reconstruction` and `performReconstruction` in `SurfaceReconstruction` to output a `PointCloud<T>` and `vector<Vertices>` as well
* added a new class called `MeshConstruction` per API design decision to split the surface reconstruction methods into topology preserving (`EarClipping, `OrganizedFastMesh`, `GreedyProjectionTriangulation`) and the rest. The new class implements a `reconstruction/performReconstruction` for `PolygonMesh` (for backwards compatibility purposes) and a faster set of the same methods for `vector<Vertices>`
* refactorized `GreedyProjectionTriangulation` by making it inherit from the new `MeshConstruction` base class, and removed a lot of old buggy code
* overloaded `performReconstruction (PointCloud<T> &, vector<Vertices> &)` per the new `SurfaceReconstruction` API
* fixed a bug in `OrganizedFastMesh` where the x/y/z indices were assumed to be 0/1/2, and made it part of the `MeshConstruction` API
* optimizations for `OrganizedFastMesh`. Now in 30Hz+ flavor.
* fixed a segfault from last night's `EarClipping` refactorization and improved the efficiency of the algorithm considerably
* updated `ConvexHull` and `ConcaveHull` to inherit from the new `MeshConstruction` class
* renamed `mesh_processing.h` to `processing.h` and `performReconstruction/reconstruct` to `performProcessing/process` for the new `MeshProcessing` API


### `libpcl_features`

* fixed bug #439: 3DSC unit test fails on MacOS
* fixed `IntegralImage2Dim` : setting first line to zero was buggy producing undefined output data.
* fixing an issue in `PrincipalCurvaturesEstimation` where the *pc1* and *pc2* magnitudes were not normalized with respect to the neighborhood size, thus making comparisons of different neighborhoods impossible (thanks Steffen!)
* fixed `ShapeContext3DEstimation` computation and unit tests by switching from `stdlib.h`'s random () to Boost.
* fixed a bug in `IntensityGradient`: need to demean also intensity values, otherwise its assumed that the hyperplane goes always through origin which is not true
* overloaded `compute` in `pcl::Feature` to save the output in an `PointCloud<Eigen::MatrixXf>`. Added partial specialization on `Eigen::MatrixXf` to all features and implemented `computeFeature (PointCloud<MatrixXf> &output)`
* major doxygenization work

* added new unit tests for the Eigen::MatrixXf output
* fixing the MacOS GCC 4.2.1 compiler segfault by removing the OpenMP #pragma (related to http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35364 ?).
* fixed bug #468: refactored to make floor explicit.
* added a `setUseInternalCache` method for `PFHEstimation` to use the internal cache on demand only. Other fixes to PFH/FPFH/PPF signatures (histogram sums were not adding up to 100.0 in some cases)
* major improvements for integral images + added template specialization for one dimensional integral images

### `libpcl_registration`

* fixed some bugs in ELCH, thanks Frits for pointing them out
* Big ELCH cleanup.

   * elch.h (API changes):
    - Use Boost bundled properties for LoopGraph, every vertex stores a
      pointer to the corresponding point cloud in graph[vertex].cloud.
    - loop_graph_ is now stored as a shared_ptr.
    - loop_start_ and loop_end_ are saved as ints for now (will change in
      the future).
    - loop_transform_ is not stored as a pointer (may change in the future).

   * elch.hpp:
    - Remove call to PCLBase::initCompute() as ELCH doesn't use a single
     input cloud or indices.
    - Change loopOptimizerAlgorithm to use start and end of the loop as
      stored in the object.
    - Adapt to API changes in elch.h.

* added 2D implementation of Normal Distributions Transform for registration (Biber, Strasser; 2003), including example tool program.
* reworked internal `Registration` API: Remove private `computeTransformation` without guess, make `computeTransformation` with guess abstract, Adapt all classes implementing `Registration` accordingly.
* implemented `SampleConsensusInitialAlignment` with initial guess (thanks Dennis Guse)
* cleaned up the `CorrespondenceRejector` API, per #375
* apply Mourad's patch for #454; add more doc comments


### `libpcl_visualization`


* fixed an issue in `pcl::visualization::PointPickingCallback` where `iren->GetMousePosition ()` didn't seem to work on some VTK versions/systems, so we replaced it instead with `iren->GetEventPosition ()` (#444 - thanks Adam!)
* fixed a bug in `PointCloudColorHandlerRGBField<sensor_msgs::PointCloud2>` where one of the offsets for Z was incorrectly calculated thus leading to erroneous data (#404 - thanks Lucas!)
* set the lighting off on `setShapeRenderingProperties` when the user tries to control the color of the object precisely (maybe add a different lighting on/off property later?)
* revert `pcl::visualization::PCLVisualizer::setShapeRenderingProperties` vtk5.2, default in ubuntu LTS, doesn't support the SetLighting method on vtkActor
* fixed an issue in `PointCloudColorHandlerRGBField` where using an "rgba" field was causing an error in pcd_viewer (#428 - thanks Maurice!)
* added `PointCloudColorHandlerHSVField`
* fixed the `PointPickingCallback` behavior on Windows 7: `iren->GetShiftKey ()` returns 4 instead of 1 (thanks bepe)
* added `updateFeatureHistogram` functionality to `PCLHistogramVisualizer`, per #456 (thanks Asil!)
* added patch from Adam Stambler (Bug #396)
* added `removePolygonMesh` to make the API more user friendly (`addPolygonMesh` was already existing, but the polygon meshes were removed using `removeShape` until now)
* made the polygon meshes actually implement `CloudActor` structures internally, so that we can use different colors per vertex
* added `updatePolygonMesh` and improved the efficiency of `addPolygonMesh` for fast online rendering (i.e., produced via `OrganizedFastMesh`)

## *= 1.3.1 (2011-11-30) =*

## *= 1.3 (2011-10-31) = :: "Gaudi" =*

From 1.3 we are constructing the Changelist for each library separately, as they can in theory be mixed and matched with older versions (though we officially do not support this yet). The 
most notable overall changes are:

* **removed wxWidgets as a dependency from PCL** and implemented the Image visualization classes using VTK
* **removed cminpack as a dependency from PCL** and implemented the LM optimization functionality using Eigen
* added a new library called **PCL Search** (`libpcl_search`) that has a more uniform API for nearest neighbor searches and stripped the unneeded functionality from `libpcl_kdtree` and `libpcl_octree`. Search now wraps KdTree and Octree for NN calls. **This is a MINOR API BREAKING CHANGE**. To change your code switch from:
```
pcl::KdTree -> pcl::Search (if the purpose is to use one of its children for search)
pcl::KdTreeFLANN -> pcl::search::KdTree
pcl::OrganizedDataIndex -> pcl::search::OrganizedNeighbor
```
* **improved MacOS support**
* improved documentation and unit tests
* added lots of application examples and demos. Note: not all have a complete functionality... we will try to clean this up in 1.4 and future releases.

### Build system changes

* define PCL_ROOT environment variable using the NSIS installer
* removing test+python from the dependency graph
* fixed bug #374
* remove cminpack from PCLConfig.cmake cmake and 3rdparty (switched to Eigen's Levenberg-Marquardt implementation)
* update NSIS.template.in : use CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY as the registry key
* added the capability to build an all-in-one installer
* fixed the build system to work 100% on Android and MacOS


### `libpcl_common`

* add overriding for operator[] to shorten code 
* add a `setIndices` method that computes indices of points in a region of interest
* add `demeanPointCloud` with indices as `PointIndices` as well
* added eigen allocator to correspondence vectors (`pcl::Correspondences`) and adapted all registration modules => be sure to use `pcl::Correspondences` instead of `std::vector<pcl::Correspondence>`
* fixed a few doxygen errors
* added simple stop watch for non-scoped function time measurements and made `ScodeTime` derived from `StopWatch`
* fixed a bug in `getRejectedQueryIndices`, wrong output when order of correspondences have been changed
* moved `getRejectedQueryIndices` to pcl/common/correspondence.h
* added more doxygen documentation to the registration components
* marked all `getRemainingCorrespondences`-functions as DEPRECATED, we should replace them with purely stateless version outside the class body
* fixed a const missing in `PolynomialCalculationsT` (#388 - thanks Julian!)
* add `PCL_DEPRECATED` macro, closes #354.
* added `PointXYZHSV` type and the conversions for it
* added check for endianness for the Android platform


### `libpcl_search`

* BIG changes introduced - migration from `KdTree` to `pcl::Search`: moved `OrganizedDataIndex` and `OrganizedNeighbor` classes to `libpcl_search`
* added new templated methods for `nearestKSearch` and `radiusSearch` for situations when PointT is different than the one the KdTree object was created with (e.g., KdTree<PointT1> vs nearestKSearch (PointT2 &p...)
* added two new methods for `getApproximateIndices` where given a reference cloud of point type T1 we're trying to find the corresponding indices in a different cloud of point type T2
* refactorized a lot of code in search and octree to make it look more consistent with the rest of the API
* fixed a bug in octree_search which was semantically doing something bad: for each `radiusSearch`/`nearestKSearch`/`approxNearestSearch` call with a PointCloudConstPtr, the octree was getting recreated. Changed the API to be consistent with the rest of PCL (including pcl_search and pcl_kdtree) where we pass in a PointCloud instead of a PointCloudConstPtr which simply calls searchMethod (cloud.points[i], ...)
* minor code optimizations
* renamed organized_neighbor.h header in pcl_search (unreleased, therefore API changes OK!) to organized.h
* disabled the auto-search tuning as it wasn't really working. must clean this up further
* remove all `approxNearestSearch` methods from the base `pcl::Search` class as they did not belong there


### `libpcl_io`

* use `stringstream` instead of `atof` because of locale issues in IO (note that we can't use the `ifstream` directly because we have to check for the `nan` value)
* added locale independent PCD ASCII i/o
* implemented `setMapSynchronization` for `pcl::PCDWriter`. When set, `msync()` will be called before `munmap()` in the `pcl::PCDWriter::write*` calls, which guarantees data reliability. Though I/O performance is 300% better when unset, data corruption might occur on NFS systems, as indicated by http://www.pcl-developers.org/PCD-IO-consistency-on-NFS-msync-needed-td4885942.html.
* added new `writeBinaryCompressed` functionality for general purpose `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2` data (which is still our generic data container in PCL 1.x)
* added additional unit tests for binary_compressed
* fixed a grave bug in `PCDReader` (most likely introduced a few releases ago due to code refactorization) where the data was incorrectly copied if a PCD ASCII file had a field with multiple count elements (field.count) as first. Binary files are not affected by this bug. Added an unit test to catch this in the future.
* added functionality for `openni_grab_frame` (added optional command line options, optional output filename, chose output format)
* changed to new location of samplesconfig.xml for OpenNI
* added signal and slot blocking into grabber. Using blocking to skip first frame in `openni_grabber`, since it is corrupted
* added PLY format file support in binary and ascii mode (requires boost::iostreams library)

### `libpcl_keypoints`

* added 3D versions of Harris/Noble/Lowe/Tomasi and Curvature-based keypoint detection... scale space still missing
* work on making `SIFTKeypoint` more flexible by saving scale only when the output point type contains "scale" (the catch is that all point types must be correctly declared via our macros - see the modifications in test_keypoints.cpp). This allows us to use a `SIFTKeypoint<PointXYZRGB, PointXYZRGB>` and thus removes the constraint on using `copyPointCloud` afterwards.
* fixed an issue in `SIFTKeypoint` where width/height were not correctly set


### `libpcl_features`

* specialize std::vector for Eigen::Matrix4f (alignment issue with msvc 32bit) in `SHOTEstimation`
* added a faster (eigen-based) integral image calculation => sped up normal estimation to 15Hz
* added Unique Shape Context (USC) feature descriptor
* added Shape Context 3D feature descriptor
* fixed a bug in the normalization factor of VFH for the distance component (only affecting if set distance component is true)
* fixed a few bugs regarding Windows build introduced in earlier commits
* BIG changes introduced - migration from `KdTree` to `pcl::Search` 
* merged libpcl_range_image_border_extractor into libpcl_features. There's absolutely no reason why we should have 2 libraries generated from the features module.

### `libpcl_filters`

* added `FilterIndices` functionality #315
* added a `RandomSample` filter which makes use of indices #323
* added a new (very fast) class for data decimation: `ApproximateVoxelGrid`
* fix for #369 (StatisticalOutlierRemoval crash when input dataset is empty)
* implemented feature request #346

### `libpcl_octree`

* added function `genVoxelBounds` to octree pointcloud class
* added octree neighbor search class
* added octree-ray-tracing patch to octree_search class
* buxfix in octree ray traversal function `getIntersectedVoxelCentersRecursive`
* added unit test for `getIntersectedVoxelCentersRecursive`
* added method `getIntersectedVoxelIndices` for getting indices of intersected voxels and updated unit test
* refactorized a lot of code in search and octree to make it look more consistent with the rest of the API
* fixed a bug in octree_search which was semantically doing something bad: for each `radiusSearch`/`nearestKSearch`/`approxNearestSearch` call with a PointCloudConstPtr, the octree was getting recreated. Changed the API to be consistent with the rest of PCL (including pcl_search and pcl_kdtree) where we pass in a PointCloud instead of a PointCloudConstPtr which simply calls searchMethod (cloud.points[i], ...)
* minor code optimizations
* renamed organized_neighbor.h header in pcl_search (unreleased, therefore API changes OK!) to organized.h
* disabled the auto-search tuning as it wasn't really working. must clean this up further
* remove all `approxNearestSearch` methods from the base `pcl::Search` class as they did not belong there

### `libpcl_registration`

* fixed a minor bug in `CorrespondenceRejectorSampleConsensus`: `getRemainingCorrespondences` tried to nput_ although it should only use the given input correspondences
* added missing implementation for `TransformationEstimationLM` on correspondence vectors
* added eigen allocator to correspondence vectors (`pcl::Correspondences`) and adapted all registration modules --> be sure to use `pcl::Correspondences` instead of `std::vector<pcl::Correspondence>`
* fixing the API: a few left inconsistencies between `vector<Correspondence>` and `Correspondences`. The latter is to be preferred as it contains the Eigen aligned allocator.
* added new ELCH loop correction API (New pcl::registration::ELCH class (WIP), add Registration::Ptr typedef)
* added unit tests for the (new) registration API and all registration components
* Further cleaning up registration code and writing documentation.
  * fixed bug in getRejectedQueryIndices, wrong output when order of correspondences have been changed
  * moved getRejectedQueryIndices to pcl/common/correspondence.h
  * added more doxygen documentation to the registration components
  * marked all "getRemainingCorrespondences"-functions as DEPRECATED, we should replace them with purely stateless version outside the class body
* Update: remove ciminpack dependency and rely on eigen for LM
* Fixed a bug in ICP-NL by modifying `WarpPointRigid` to preserve the value of the 4th coordinate when warping; Re-enabled missing unit tests for ICP and ICP-NL
* Added point-to-plane ICP
* added nr_iterations_ and max_iterations_ to the initializer list (were missing)
* Fixed bugs in `WarpPointRigid3D` and `TransformationEstimationLM`
* fixed a problem where if no correspondences would be found via `nearestKSearch`, the RANSAC-based rejection scheme would fail (thanks to James for reporting this)
* changed the default LM implementation to use L2 instead of L2SQR
* Added a new `TransformationEstimationPointToPlaneLLS` class that uses a Linear Least-Squares approximation to minimize the point-to-plane distance between two point clouds
* Added the ability to specify the error function to be minimized in SAC-IA (see Feature #362)


### `libpcl_sample_consensus`

* reimplemented the Levenberg Marquardt code that was using cminpack with Eigen, thus dropping the cminpack dependency for PCL

### `libpcl_surface`

* fixed bug in surface/mls: when no search interface and no tree is given, mls creates its' own tree, but didn'tupdate the search method to use 
* added citation for Rosie's work (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1839808)
* added some error checking for missing/ill formed inputs for `MarchingCubes`
* don't delete smart pointers (thanks Chytu: http://www.pcl-users.org/Seg-fault-while-using-VTK-Smoother-tp3380114p3381648.html)
* added computation of area and volume for convex hulls.

### `libpcl_segmentation`

* added a labeled cluster euclidean segmentation method

### `libpcl_visualization`

* fixed an issue where `saveScreenshot` was not correctly initialized with the proper renderer, thus not saving the data
* supporting fontsize in addText (per feature #365)
* fixing the interactor style by ignoring all combinations in `OnChar` that we cover in `OnKeyDown` 
* added `removeAllShapes` and `removeAllPointClouds` per #353
* renamed `deleteText3D` to `removeText3D` to consolidate the API
* fixing the API: a few left inconsistencies between `vector<Correspondence>` and `Correspondences`. The latter is to be preferred as it contains the Eigen aligned allocator.
* added patch from Lucas Walter to fix pcl::visualization::PCLVisualizer::removeAllPointClouds and removeAllShapes
* fixed a few doxygen errors
* cleaned up the `PCLHistogramVisualizer` API by moving to a vtk interactor instead of ours, and removed unnecessary calls such as `saveScreenShot` (never used with the histogram visualizer, and most likely buggy), `wasStopped` and `resetStoppedFlag` (never used).
* removed `PCLVisualizerInteractor` and switched back to a better default `vktWindowRenderInteractor` for VTK >= 5.6. Adjusted and fixed the internal API. No public API changes were made (except the removal of the `PCLVisualizerInteractor` class which was never meant to be used externally anyway).
* cleaned up and implemented the `ImageViewer` class properly and demonstrated it in a single thread via openni_viewer. The other tool (openni_viewer_simple) will not work due to `CloudViewer` starting its own thread and thus clashing on the same OpenGL context.
* fixed the correct order in initializer list for ImageViewer
* **removed wxWidgets completely** from the codebase
* added implementation for `markPoint` to `ImageViewer` to mimic older wxWidgets-based code
* fixed an issue in `PCLVisualizerInteractorStyle` where mouse events were not properly mapped in Qt (#389 - thanks Adam!)
* added an extra field of view to the camera paramers (#392 - thanks Adam!)
* small bugfix when the radius_sphere was different than 1 for `renderViewTesselatedSphere`



## *= 1.2 (2011-09-30) = :: "Enough small talk" (LM) =*

### Additions, improvements, and optimizations

* added a new `countWithinDistance` method to `SampleConsensusModel` (r2326), and optimized RANSAC and RRANSAC by replacing calls to `selectWithinDistance` with `countWithinDistance` (r2327)
* added feature #330: new PCLVisualizer::addCube and pcl::visualization::createCube methods (r2322)
* added `correspondence.h` to the includes in `common/CMakeLists.txt` (r2260)

# Pre 1.0 (copied from http://pcl.ros.org/ChangeList) - for historical purposes. 

The version numbers below belong to the *perception_pcl* stack in ROS, which coordinated both the release of PCL, as well as the release of the ROS PCL wrappers. From 1.0 onwards PCL got separated from ROS, and the release process of *perception_pcl* and PCL diverged.

* [[flann]]

 * Updated to version 1.6.8

* [[pcl]]

 * bug fix in _pcl::PassThrough_ filter, where the output data size was not set correctly when _keep_organized_ was set to false
 * bug fix in _pcl::GreedyProjectionTriangulation_, where point distances were incorrect, thus poroducing too many holes points during reconstruction ()
 * added more elaborate unit tests for surface reconstruction
 * Added possibility to restrict no of returned interest points to _pcl::NarfKeypoint_
 * Added parameter to control no of openmp threads to _pcl::NarfKeypoint_

* [[pcl_ros]]

 * added the _keep_organized_ option to _pcl_ros::Passthrough_ (#4627)

## *= 0.10.0 (2010-02-25) =*

* Re-versioned 0.9.9 to follow patch-versioning semantics.

## *= 0.9.9 (2010-02-22) :: "Almost there" edition =*

* [[pcl]]

 * removed _ConvexHull2D_ (*API breaking change!*)
    You need to change your code. From:
    ```
    pcl::ConvexHull2D<...> ...;
    ```
    to
    ```
    pcl::ConvexHull<...> ...;
    ```
 * added a new general purpose 2D/3D _ConvexHull_ class based on QHull
 * added a new general purpose 2D/3D _ConcaveHull_ class based on QHull
 * added helper _transformPointCloud_ method for cloud+indices as input
 * fixed: segfaults when ICP finds no correspondences (#4618)
 * improved the PCD I/O capabilities (for binary PCD) to deal with SSE padding
 * Added possibility to create a _RangeImagePlanar_ from a point cloud
 * Corrected is_dense to false in all range images.
 * Reimplemented big parts of the NARF keypoint extraction - should be more reliable now (and unfortunately slower) - uses polynomials to search maxima now.
 * Added helper classes for polynomial approximations to common
 * Added a new RANSAC-like algorithm: _PROSAC_ (much faster when there is a confidence for the matches)

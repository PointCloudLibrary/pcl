  * \section secGraphPresentation Overview
  *
  * **pcl_graph** is an experimental library that aims to provide a common toolbox to aid development of graph-based 3D
  * processing algorithms within the PCL framework. The library has a strong influence from
  * [Boost Graph Library][BGLTOC] and relies on the concepts, classes, and algorithms found there.
  *
  * At the heart of the library lies the pcl::graph::point_cloud_graph class, which may be considered to be a blend of a
  * PCL point cloud and [boost::adjacency_list][AdjacencyList] (the most common graph representation in BGL). As such,
  * this class may be used in PCL algorithms where a point cloud input is expected, as well as in BGL algorithms, where
  * a graph is needed.

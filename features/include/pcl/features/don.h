  /** \brief A Difference of Normals (DoN) scale filter implementation for point cloud data.
   *
   * For each point in the point cloud two normals estimated with a differing search radius (sigma_s, sigma_l)
   * are subtracted, the difference of these normals provides a scale-based feature which
   * can be further used to filter the point cloud, somewhat like the Difference of Guassians
   * in image processing, but instead on surfaces. Best results are had when the two search
   * radii are related as sigma_l=10*sigma_s, the octaves between the two search radii
   * can be though of as a filter bandwidth. For appropriate values and thresholds it
   * can be used for surface edge extraction.
   *
   * \attention The input normals given by setInputNormalsSmall and setInputNormalsLarge have
   * to match the input point cloud given by setInputCloud. This behavior is different than
   * feature estimation methods that extend FeatureFromNormals, which match the normals
   * with the search surface.
   *

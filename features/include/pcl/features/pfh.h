    * \attention 
    * The convention for PFH features is:
    *   - if a query point's nearest neighbors cannot be estimated, the PFH feature will be set to NaN 
    *     (not a number)
    *   - it is impossible to estimate a PFH descriptor for a point that
    *     doesn't have finite 3D coordinates. Therefore, any point that contains
    *     NaN data on x, y, or z, will have its PFH feature property set to NaN.
    *
    * \note The code is stateful as we do not expect this class to be multicore parallelized. Please look at
    * \ref FPFHEstimationOMP for examples on parallel implementations of the FPFH (Fast Point Feature Histogram).

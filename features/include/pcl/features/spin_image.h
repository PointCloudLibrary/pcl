  /** \brief Estimates spin-image descriptors in the  given input points. 
    *  
    * This class represents spin image descriptor. Spin image is
    * a histogram of point locations summed along the bins of the image.
    * A 2D accumulator indexed by <VAR>a</VAR> and <VAR>b</VAR> is created. Next, 
    * the coordinates (<VAR>a</VAR>, <VAR>b</VAR>) are computed for a vertex in 
    * the surface mesh that is within the support of the spin image 
    * (explained below). The bin indexed by (<VAR>a</VAR>, <VAR>b</VAR>) in 
    * the accumulator is then incremented; bilinear interpolation is used 
    * to smooth the contribution of the vertex. This procedure is repeated 
    * for all vertices within the support of the spin image. 
    * The resulting accumulator can be thought of as an image; 
    * dark areas in the image correspond to bins that contain many projected points. 
    * As long as the size of the bins in the accumulator is greater 
    * than the median distance between vertices in the mesh 
    * (the definition of mesh resolution), the position of individual 
    * vertices will be averaged out during spin image generation.
    *
    * \attention The input normals given by \ref setInputNormals have to match
    * the input point cloud given by \ref setInputCloud. This behavior is
    * different than feature estimation methods that extend \ref
    * FeatureFromNormals, which match the normals with the search surface.
    *
    * With the default parameters, pcl::Histogram<153> is a good choice for PointOutT.
    * Of course the dimension of this descriptor must change to match the number
    * of bins set by the parameters.
    *

    *    Recognition in Complex 3D Scenes. Image and Vision Computing, 16,

    * 
    * The class also implements radial spin images and spin-images in angular domain 
    * (or both).

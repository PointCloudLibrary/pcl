    * \attention
    * The convention for FPFH features is:
    *   - if a query point's nearest neighbors cannot be estimated, the FPFH feature will be set to NaN
    *     (not a number)
    *   - it is impossible to estimate a FPFH descriptor for a point that
    *     doesn't have finite 3D coordinates. Therefore, any point that contains
    *     NaN data on x, y, or z, will have its FPFH feature property set to NaN.

/// mouse input.  It then updates the cloud's transform matrix for the
/// selected points so that the transformed and selected points will be
/// rendered appropriately. Note that, the actual coordinates of the selected
/// points are not updated until the end of the mouse input. At the end of a
/// mouse input (i.e. when the mouse button is released), a transform command is
/// created to update the actual coordinates of the selected points.

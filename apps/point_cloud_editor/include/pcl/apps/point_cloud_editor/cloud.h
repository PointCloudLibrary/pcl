/// @brief A wrapper which allows to use any implementation of cloud provided by
/// a third-party library.
/// @details This wrapper attempts to create a simple interface for displaying
/// and modifying point clouds.  It is common for point clouds to have
/// coordinate values that are exceptionally large, especially when dealing
/// with the GIS community.  As such this class shifts the stored point cloud
/// according to the minimum in each of the coordinate directions.  The
/// interface presented by this class then serves the shifted points in order to
/// reduce any precision errors that may occur due to sums of large values.
/// Functions also exist for accessing the unshifted versions of the points,
/// however most operations performed on the cloud will expect it to live near
/// the origin.
// XXX - handle shifting upon setting of a Cloud3D
// XXX - add functions for retrieving an unshifted Cloud3D
// XXX - add functions for retrieveing unshifted points by index
// XXX - mark access functions below as returning shifted values

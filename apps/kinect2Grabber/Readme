The grabber is still in an early stage.
You need libfreenect2 in order to use the grabber. Test the protonect example provided by libfreenect2 in order
to be sure that your system is compatible with the kinect v2.

To build the grabber test you need to specify some cmake variables in order to find the correct libfreenect2 includes, libraries and dependencies.
Here is an example of cmake invocation:

cmake .. 
-DGLEW_LIB=/home/gf/Libraries/libfreenect2/depends/glew/lib64/libGLEW.so 
-DGLFW_LIB=/home/gf/Libraries/libfreenect2/examples/protonect/lib/libglfw.so.3.0 
-DGLEW_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/gf/Libraries/libfreenect2/depends/glew/include 
-DGLEWF_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/gf/Libraries/libfreenect2/depends/glfw/include 
-DLIBFREENECT2_LIB=/home/gf/Libraries/libfreenect2/examples/protonect/lib/libfreenect2.so

As soon as libfreenect2 will be finished I will create a stand alone cmake file. If you want to use the grabber just include the .hpp file and use the grabber as shown in the test file. (test.cpp).
It is possible to specify the cloud dimension that you want, but for now this feature is not working correctly so avoid it.

I have added my own claibration files n order to show you the format in which they should be. If needed I can add the code to acquire N images to calibrate the camera.

For any questions or doubts don't hesitate to contact me.

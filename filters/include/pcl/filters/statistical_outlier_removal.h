  /** \brief @b StatisticalOutlierRemoval uses point neighborhood statistics to filter outlier data.
    * \details The algorithm iterates through the entire input twice:
    * During the first iteration it will compute the average distance that each point has to its nearest k neighbors.
    * The value of k can be set using setMeanK().
    * Next, the mean and standard deviation of all these distances are computed in order to determine a distance threshold.
    * The distance threshold will be equal to: mean + stddev_mult * stddev.
    * The multiplier for the standard deviation can be set using setStddevMulThresh().
    * During the next iteration the points will be classified as inlier or outlier if their average neighbor distance is below or above this threshold respectively.
    * <br>
    * The neighbors found for each query point will be found amongst ALL points of setInputCloud(), not just those indexed by setIndices().
    * The setIndices() method only indexes the points that will be iterated through as search query points.

    * Usage example:
    * \code
    * pcl::StatisticalOutlierRemoval<PointType> sorfilter (true); // Initializing with true will allow us to extract the removed indices
    * sorfilter.setInputCloud (cloud_in);
    * sorfilter.setMeanK (8);
    * sorfilter.setStddevMulThresh (1.0);
    * sorfilter.filter (*cloud_out);
    * // The resulting cloud_out contains all points of cloud_in that have an average distance to their 8 nearest neighbors that is below the computed threshold
    * // Using a standard deviation multiplier of 1.0 and assuming the average distances are normally distributed there is a 84.1% chance that a point will be an inlier
    * indices_rem = sorfilter.getRemovedIndices ();
    * // The indices_rem array indexes all points of cloud_in that are outliers

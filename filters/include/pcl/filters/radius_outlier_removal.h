  /** \brief @b RadiusOutlierRemoval filters points in a cloud based on the number of neighbors they have.
    * \details Iterates through the entire input once, and for each point, retrieves the number of neighbors within a certain radius.
    * The point will be considered an outlier if it has too few neighbors, as determined by setMinNeighborsInRadius().
    * The radius can be changed using setRadiusSearch().
    * <br>
    * The neighbors found for each query point will be found amongst ALL points of setInputCloud(), not just those indexed by setIndices().
    * The setIndices() method only indexes the points that will be iterated through as search query points.
    * <br><br>
    * Usage example:
    * \code
    * pcl::RadiusOutlierRemoval<PointType> rorfilter (true); // Initializing with true will allow us to extract the removed indices
    * rorfilter.setInputCloud (cloud_in);
    * rorfilter.setRadiusSearch (0.1);
    * rorfilter.setMinNeighborsInRadius (5);
    * rorfilter.setNegative (true);
    * rorfilter.filter (*cloud_out);
    * // The resulting cloud_out contains all points of cloud_in that have 4 or less neighbors within the 0.1 search radius
    * indices_rem = rorfilter.getRemovedIndices ();
    * // The indices_rem array indexes all points of cloud_in that have 5 or more neighbors within the 0.1 search radius
    * \endcode

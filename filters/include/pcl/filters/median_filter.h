  /** \brief Implementation of the median filter.
    * The median filter is one of the simplest and wide-spread image processing filters. It is known to perform well
    * with "shot"/impulse noise (some individual pixels having extreme values), it does not reduce contrast across steps
    * in the function (as compared to filters based on averaging), and it is robust to outliers. Furthermore, it is
    * simple to implement and efficient, as it requires a single pass over the image. It consists of a moving window of
    * fixed size that replaces the pixel in the center with the median inside the window.
    *
    * \note This algorithm filters only the depth (z-component) of _organized_ and untransformed (i.e., in camera coordinates)
    * point clouds. An error will be outputted if an unorganized cloud is given to the class instance.

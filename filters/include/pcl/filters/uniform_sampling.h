  /** \brief @b UniformSampling assembles a local 3D grid over a given PointCloud, and downsamples + filters the data.
    *
    * The @b UniformSampling class creates a *3D voxel grid* (think about a voxel
    * grid as a set of tiny 3D boxes in space) over the input point cloud data.
    * Then, in each *voxel* (i.e., 3D box), all the points present will be
    * approximated (i.e., *downsampled*) with their centroid. This approach is
    * a bit slower than approximating them with the center of the voxel, but it
    * represents the underlying surface more accurately.

      * It is an iterative smoothing subsampling algorithm.
      * The subsampling is fixed to 2. Two smoothing kernels may be used:
      * - [1/16 1/4 3/8 1/4 1/16] slower but produces finer result;
      * - [1/4 1/2 1/2] the more conventional binomial kernel which is faster.
      * We use a memory efficient algorithm so the convolving and subsampling are combined in a 
      * single step.

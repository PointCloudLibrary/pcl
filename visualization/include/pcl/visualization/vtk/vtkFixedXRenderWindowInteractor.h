/**
 * @class   vtkXRenderWindowInteractor
 * @brief   an X event driven interface for a RenderWindow
 *
 * vtkXRenderWindowInteractor is a convenience object that provides event
 * bindings to common graphics functions. For example, camera and actor
 * functions such as zoom-in/zoom-out, azimuth, roll, and pan. IT is one of
 * the window system specific subclasses of vtkRenderWindowInteractor. Please
 * see vtkRenderWindowInteractor documentation for event bindings.

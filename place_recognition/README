Software: 3D-SMART - Place Recognition
Last Modification: 2013-05-07

PREAMBLE #######################################################################

We use CMake to build 3D-SMART - Place Recognition, so you need to install CMake
on your system. The CMakeLists.txt, which is analogous to a Makefile as used by
make, will tell CMake how to build it.

If you're unfamiliar with CMakeLists.txt, that's ok, because place_recognition
follows a very simple pattern. Of course, you can always understand or use the
full power of CMake, for which you may want to consult the CMake documentation
(http://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_2.8.11_Docs).


INSTALLATION ###################################################################

The detailed preconditions are:

  - PCL (Point Cloud Library) is installed
  - OpenCV is installed
  - Qt4 installed as default Qt version

If you don't own them on your Linux system, please install them one by one.


USAGE ##########################################################################

Compile place_recognition:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make


The following instructions assume you have owned database files, which are some
ones storing the global spatial features and local SURF features in database
scenes. Otherwise please create database files through two steps
Graph->Load Data (Ctrl+L) and Recognition->Extract Features (Ctrl+E) successively.

1. Please load 3D laser scanning data of query scene (Graph->Load Data (Ctrl+L));

2. Place recognition for query scene (Recognition->Place Recognition (Ctrl+P)).

Optionally, you can show query scene Bearing-Angle image (Graph->Show BA Image
(Ctrl+B)) and Flowsheet (Graph->Show Flowsheet (Ctrl+F)) of the software; Clicked
the "View" Menu, you can also show or hide 3D and 2D display.


If you have any questions regarding usage of 3D-SMART - Place Recognition,
please let me know or refer to our recent published paper (IEEE Transactions
on Instrument and Measurement, Vol. 62, No. 2, 2013).

  /** \brief Stereo Matching abstract class 
    *
    * The class performs stereo matching on a rectified stereo pair 
    * Includes the following functionalities:
    * * preprocessing of the image pair, to improve robustness against photometric distortions
    *   (wrt. to a spatially constant additive photometric factor)
    * * postprocessing: filtering of wrong disparities via Peak Filter (eliminating ambiguities due to low-textured regions) 
    *   and Ratio Filter (eliminating generic matching ambiguities, similar to that present in OpenCV Block Matching Stereo)
    * * postprocessing: Left-Right consistency check (eliminates wrong disparities at the cost of twice the stereo matching 
    *   computation)
    * * postprocessing: subpixel refinement of computed disparities, to reduce the depth quantization effect
    * * postprocessing: smoothing of the disparity map via median filter
    * * after stereo matching a PCL point cloud can be computed, given the stereo intrinsic (focal, principal point  
    *   coordinates) and extrinsic (baseline) calibration parameters

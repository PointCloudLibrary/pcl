    /** \brief Globally Consistent Scan Matching based on an algorithm by Lu and Milios.
      * \details A GraphSLAM algorithm where registration data is managed in a graph:
      * <ul>
      *  <li>Vertices represent poses and hold the point cloud data and relative transformations.</li>
      *  <li>Edges represent pose constraints and hold the correspondence data between two point clouds.</li>
      * </ul>
      * Computation uses the first point cloud in the SLAM graph as a reference pose and attempts to align all other point clouds to it simultaneously.
      * For more information:
      * <ul><li>

      * In Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization and Transmission (3DPVT '08), June 2008

      * Usage example:
      * \code

      * // Add point clouds as vertices to the SLAM graph
      * lum.addPointCloud (cloud_0);

      * corrs_2_to_0 = someAlgo (lum.getPointCloud (2), lum.getPointCloud (0));
      * // Add the correspondence results as edges to the SLAM graph
      * lum.setCorrespondences (0, 1, corrs_0_to_1);
      * lum.setCorrespondences (1, 2, corrs_1_to_2);

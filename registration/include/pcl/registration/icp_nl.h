  /** \brief @b IterativeClosestPointNonLinear is an ICP variant that uses Levenberg-Marquardt optimization 
    * backend. The resultant transformation is optimized as a quaternion.
    *
    * The algorithm has several termination criteria:
    *
    * <ol>
    * <li>Number of iterations has reached the maximum user imposed number of iterations 
    *     (via \ref setMaximumIterations)</li>
    * <li>The epsilon (difference) between the previous transformation and the current estimated transformation is 
    *     smaller than an user imposed value (via \ref setTransformationEpsilon)</li>
    * <li>The sum of Euclidean squared errors is smaller than a user defined threshold 
    *     (via \ref setEuclideanFitnessEpsilon)</li>
    * </ol>

  \section secRegistrationPresentation Overview

Combining several datasets into a global consistent model is usually performed
using a technique called registration. The key idea is to identify
corresponding points between the data sets and find a transformation that
minimizes the distance (alignment error) between corresponding points. This
process is repeated, since correspondence search is affected by the relative
position and orientation of the data sets. Once the alignment errors fall below
a given threshold, the registration is said to be complete.

The <b>pcl_registration</b> library implements a plethora of point cloud
registration algorithms for both organized and unorganized (general purpose)
datasets.

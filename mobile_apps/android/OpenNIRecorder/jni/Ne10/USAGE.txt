#Using NE10

NE10 is implemented in a mix of C, intrinsics and assembler, however all
functions are exposed as C.  It can be used as a shared or static library and
individual functions can be safely excluded from a build to reduce final
binary size.

##General Notes

The type checking is relaxed, to enable compatiblity with any pre-existing or
prevailing system of types a project might have.  The debug version of the
library will check the ranges passed in a call conform to the API limitations.
The production version avoids these checks for performance reasons.

It is assumed that the ranges of input arrays to be processed do not overlap.
Clean handling of overlapping arrays is not designed for or tested.  It is
possible for source and destination pointers to be the same, or for you to pass
in pointers inside the same array *as long as the regions indicated by
pointer+length do not overlap*.  Incorrect usage will typically result in an assert
in debug builds and variable and inaccurate results in production builds.

##C Bindings

The C bindings (available in inc/NE10.h) aim for a balance between simple to
use and efficient from a execution perspective.  They are intended to be usable
in C and C++ code, or in theory, in any other language with a well constructed
mechanism for calling out to C code.

The calls themselves are listed in inc/NE10.h, however depending on your
circumstances - for example knowing that you are only going to be executing
code on platforms with NEON available, then you could use the inc/NE10_neon.h
include file and access those functions directly.

Usage of all the functions is generally consistent, and function specific
differences documented in the header, but here is an example as a taste:

    arm_vec3f_t *destination;
    arm_vec3f_t *source1;
    arm_vec3f_t *source2;
    int feedback;

    /* Fill your arrays with interesting vector data.. */
      ...
    
    /* Normalize the vectors in source1, returning the result in place */
    feedback = normalize_vec3f(source1, source1);
    if (feedback = <check error code>) {
	   printf("Bad Thing happened normalizing!\n");
	}
	/* Multiply source1 by source2, returning the result in destination */
	feedback = mul_vec3f(destination, source1, source2);
    if (feedback = <check error code>) {
	   printf("Bad Thing happened multiplying!\n");
	}

While the functions all return an integer value to indicate success or failure,
in practice almost none of the functions currently implemented can 'fail' in that
way, however future functions may. This is to allow for a more consistent interface
across the API in the future.

##Future Bindings

We hope to to add C++ bindings at a later date, based on feedback on the most
appropriate way to provide that sort of API.  Other languages will be
considered, however the priority will be to improve the scope and performance
of functions provided under the existing bindings.

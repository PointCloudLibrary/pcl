==========
1. Preface
==========

1-a. License details
--------------------
NE10 is an open source project released under the Apache License,
Version 2.0 (ALv2).  See the file LICENSE for the full text of the ALv2.


1-b. Product status
-------------------
This is the first publicly available version of NE10. This open source project
is actively under development and more functions as well as improved versions of
the available functions will be contributed to the source code.


==================
2. Release details
==================

2-a. Product release status
---------------------------
Version 1.0 beta

The set of functions planned for this release are in place.  However some issues
remain where their intended behaviour diverges from the planned specification:

In the release version, unless impractical and explicitly stated, all functions
will operate correctly when the output area of the result is the same as one
of the input areas. (ie. where the src1 or src2 parameter == the dst parameter)

In this beta release that behaviour cannot be assumed.

2-b. Functions included
---------------------------
NE10 is a software library that provides Linux and Android support for Single
Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) functionality. In this release, a number of
mathematical functions (mainly vector and scalar operations) have been
implemented for the ARM v7 instruction set architecture as well as ARM NEON
SIMD architecture extensions.

This library has been developed and tested on the following processors:

  1) ARM Cortex-A9 with NEON extension
  2) ARM Cortex-A8 with NEON extension

The following is a list of currently available functions.

  a) Vector-Constant Arithmetic

   addc_float, addc_vec2f, addc_vec3f, addc_vec4f,
   subc_float, subc_vec2f, subc_vec3f, subc_vec4f,
   rsbc_float, rsbc_vec2f, rsbc_vec3f, rsbc_vec4f,
   mulc_float, mulc_vec2f, mulc_vec3f, mulc_vec4f,

   setc_float, setc_vec2f, setc_vec3f, setc_vec4f,
   mlac_float, mlac_vec2f, mlac_vec3f, mlac_vec4f

  b) Arithmetic functions over arrays of cst values:

   add_float, sub_float, mul_float, div_float, mla_float, abs_float

  c) Operations on Vectors:

   abs_vec2f, abs_vec3f, abs_vec4f,
   addc_vec2f, addc_vec3f, addc_vec4f,
   add_vec2f, add_vec3f, add_vec4f,
   divc_vec2f, divc_vec3f, divc_vec4f,
   dot_vec2f, dot_vec3f, dot_vec4f
   len_vec2f, len_vec3f, len_vec4f,
   mlac_vec2f, mlac_vec3f, mlac_vec4f,
   mulc_vec2f, mulc_vec3f, mulc_vec4f,
   normalize_vec2f, normalize_vec3f, normalize_vec4f,
   rsbc_vec2f, rsbc_vec3f, rsbc_vec4f,
   setc_vec2f, setc_vec3f, setc_vec4f,
   subc_vec2f, subc_vec3f, subc_vec4f,
   sub_vec2f, sub_vec3f, sub_vec4f,
   vdiv_vec2f, vdiv_vec3f, vdiv_vec4f,
   vmla_vec2f, vmla_vec3f, vmla_vec4f,
   vmul_vec2f, vmul_vec3f, vmul_vec4f,
   cross_vec3f

  d) Matrix operations:

   addmat_2x2f, addmat_3x3f, addmat_4x4f,
   detmat_2x2f, detmat_3x3f, detmat_4x4f,
   divmat_2x2f, divmat_3x3f, divmat_4x4f,
   identitymat_2x2f, identitymat_3x3f, identitymat_4x4f,
   invmat_2x2f, invmat_3x3f, invmat_4x4f,
   mulcmatvec_2x2f, mulcmatvec_3x3f, mulcmatvec_4x4f,
   mulmat_2x2f, mulmat_3x3f, mulmat_4x4f,
   multrans_mat2x2f, multrans_mat3x3f, multrans_mat4x4f,
   setmat_2x2f, setmat_3x3f, setmat_4x4f,
   submat_2x2f, submat_3x3f, submat_4x4f,
   transmat_2x2f, transmat_3x3f, transmat_4x4f,

2-c. Test cases and results
---------------------------
The provided functions are categorized according to the operations that they
perform.  Functions in each of these categories accept different types of input
data. Each set is accompanied with a unit test. These unit tests are provided
as part of this library and can be used to verify and benchmark these functions
on a target platform.

===============
3. Installation
===============

3-a. Requirements
-----------------
This release has been built and tested on the following host environments:

 1) ARM Versatile Express / Linux linaro 2.6.38-1003
 2) BeagleBoard RevC / Linux linaro-developer 3.1.0-4
 3) Android AOSP Emulator / Android Open Source Project Toolchain


The source code has been successfully built with the following toolchains:

 1) Linaro GCC v4.6.1 ( https://launchpad.net/gcc-linaro/4.6 )
 2) Prebuilt GCC toolchain provided with ICS release of ASOP


3-b. Native Building
--------------------

Native building (building directly on an ARM platform) is supported via

    make

This will build a libne10.a and libne10.so in the local directory along with
some test binaries.

    ./nightly.pl

Will build and run a set of tests

3-c. Android Building

To build as part of the Android Open Source Project, copy the release
directory into 'external' within the source directories and build as
normal.  This will install the libne10.so library into system/lib on the
final Android OS image, where other applications will be able to access it in
a similar way to other shared libraries.  You will need to build with
TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT=armv7-a-neon defined to enable NEON support.

3-d. Alternative Approach
-------------------------
While not supported, the functions within this library can be taken and
incorporated (licensing conflicts permitting) within other projects as is.
Details of how to do this are too project specific to detail here.

        intended as best-practice examples.

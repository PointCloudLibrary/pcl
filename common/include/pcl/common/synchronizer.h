  /** /brief This template class synchronizes two data streams of different types.
   *         The data can be added using add0 and add1 methods which expects also a timestamp of type unsigned long.
   *         If two matching data objects are found, registered callback functions are invoked with the objects and the time stamps.
   *         The only assumption of the timestamp is, that they are in the same unit, linear and strictly monotonic increasing.
   *         If filtering is desired, e.g. thresholding of time differences, the user can do that in the callback method.
   *         This class is thread safe.

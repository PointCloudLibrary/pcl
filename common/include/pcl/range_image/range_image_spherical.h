  /** \brief @b RangeImageSpherical is derived from the original range image and uses a slightly different
    * spherical projection. In the original range image, the image will appear more and more
    * "scaled down" along the y axis, the further away from the mean line of the image a point is.
    * This class removes this scaling, which makes it especially suitable for spinning LIDAR sensors
    * that capure a 360Â° view, since a rotation of the sensor will now simply correspond to a shift of the
    * range image. (This class is similar to RangeImagePlanar, but changes less of the behaviour of the base class.)

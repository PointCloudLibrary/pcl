  Description:
    ON_CompressStream delivers the compressed stream by calling
    a compressed stream output handler function.  There are two
    options for specifying the compressed stream output handler
    function.
      1. Overriding the virtual Out() function.
      2. Providing a callback function.
    SetCallback() is used to specify a callback function to handle
    the compressed stream and to specify a context pointer to be
    passed to either option of the handler.
  Parameters:
    callback_function - [in]
      Function to call with sections of the compressed stream.
      If callback_function is null, then the virtual Out()
      function will be called. When callback_function
      is specified, it must return true if the compression
      calculation should continue and false to cancel the
      compression calculation.
    callback_context - [in]
      This value is passed as the first argument when calling
      callback_function or the virutal Out() function.
  Returns:
    True if successful.
  Remarks:
    Once compression has started, it would be unusual to
    intentionally change the compressed stream output handler,
    but you can do this if you need to.

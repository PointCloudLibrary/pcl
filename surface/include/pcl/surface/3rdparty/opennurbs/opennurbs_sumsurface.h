  Description:
    Search for a derivatitive, tangent, or curvature
    discontinuity.
  Parameters:
    dir - [in] If 0, then "u" parameter is checked.  If 1, then
               the "v" parameter is checked.
    c - [in] type of continity to test for.
    t0 - [in] Search begins at t0. If there is a discontinuity
              at t0, it will be ignored.  This makes it
              possible to repeatedly call GetNextDiscontinuity
              and step through the discontinuities.
    t1 - [in] (t0 != t1)  If there is a discontinuity at t1 is
              will be ingored unless c is a locus discontinuity
              type and t1 is at the start or end of the curve.
    t - [out] if a discontinuity is found, then *t reports the
          parameter at the discontinuity.
    hint - [in/out] if GetNextDiscontinuity will be called
       repeatedly, passing a "hint" with initial value *hint=0
       will increase the speed of the search.
    dtype - [out] if not NULL, *dtype reports the kind of
        discontinuity found at *t.  A value of 1 means the first
        derivative or unit tangent was discontinuous.  A value
        of 2 means the second derivative or curvature was
        discontinuous.  A value of 0 means teh curve is not
        closed, a locus discontinuity test was applied, and
        t1 is at the start of end of the curve.
    cos_angle_tolerance - [in] default = cos(1 degree) Used only
        when c is ON::G1_continuous or ON::G2_continuous.  If the
        cosine of the angle between two tangent vectors is
        <= cos_angle_tolerance, then a G1 discontinuity is reported.
    curvature_tolerance - [in] (default = ON_SQRT_EPSILON) Used
        only when c is ON::G2_continuous.  If K0 and K1 are
        curvatures evaluated from above and below and
        |K0 - K1| > curvature_tolerance, then a curvature
        discontinuity is reported.
  Returns:
    Parametric continuity tests c = (C0_continuous, ..., G2_continuous):

      true if a parametric discontinuity was found strictly
      between t0 and t1. Note well that all curves are
      parametrically continuous at the ends of their domains.

    Locus continuity tests c = (C0_locus_continuous, ...,G2_locus_continuous):

      true if a locus discontinuity was found strictly between
      t0 and t1 or at t1 is the at the end of a curve.
      Note well that all open curves (IsClosed()=false) are locus
      discontinuous at the ends of their domains.  All closed
      curves (IsClosed()=true) are at least C0_locus_continuous at

Description:
  Intersect two lines.
Parameters:
  lineA - [in]
  lineB - [in]
  double* a - [out]
  double* b - [out] The shortest distance between the lines is the
                   chord from lineA.PointAt(*a) to lineB.PointAt(*b).
  tolerance - [in] If > 0.0, then an intersection is reported only
                   if the distance between the points is <= tolerance.
                   If <= 0.0, then the closest point between the lines
                   is reported.
  bIntersectSegments - [in] if true, the input lines are treated
                           as finite segments.  If false, the
                           input lines are treated as infinite lines.
Returns:
  True if a closest point can be calculated and the result passes
  the tolerance parameter test.
See Also:
  ON_Intersect( const ON_Line& lineA, const ON_Line& line B)
Remarks:
  If the lines are exactly parallel, meaning the system of equations
  used to find a and b has no numerical solution, then false is returned.
  If the lines are nearly parallel, which is often numerically true
  even if you think the lines look exactly parallel, then the
  closest points are found and true is returned.  So, if you
  care about weeding out "parallel" lines, then you need to
  do something like the following.

          bool rc = ON_IntersectLineLine(lineA,lineB,
                                         &a,&b,
                                         tolerance,
                                         bIntersectSegments);
          if (rc)
          {
            double angle_tolerance_radians = 0.5*ON_PI/180.0; // or whatever
            double parallel_tol = cos(angle_tolerance_radians);
            if ( fabs(lineA.Tangent()*lineB.Tangent()) >= parallel_tol )
            {
              ... do whatever you think is appropriate
            }
          }

Description:

Description:
  Intersect an infinite line and an axis aligned bounding box.
Parameters:
  bbox - [in]
  line - [in]
  tolerance - [in]  If tolerance > 0.0, then the intersection is
                   performed against a box that has each side
                   moved out by tolerance.
  line_parameters - [out]
    Pass null if you do not need the parameters.
    If true is returned and line.from != line.to,
    then the chord from line.PointAt(line_parameters[0])
    to line.PointAt(line_parameters[1]) is the intersection.
    If true is returned and line.from = line.to, then line.from
    is in the box and the interval (0.0,0.0) is returned.
    If false is returned, the input value of line_parameters
    is not changed.
Returns:
  True if the line intersects the box and false otherwise.

Legal Stuff:

  The openNURBS Initiative provides CAD, CAM, CAE, and computer
  graphics software developers the tools to accurately transfer
  3-D geometry between applications.

  The tools provided by openNURBS include:

    * C++ source code libraries to read and write the file format.

    * Quality assurance and revision control.

    * Various supporting libraries and utilities.

    * Technical support.

  Unlike other open development initiatives, alliances, or
  consortia:

    * Commercial use is encouraged.

    * The tools, support, and membership are free.

    * There are no restrictions. Neither copyright nor copyleft
	  restrictions apply.

    * No contribution of effort or technology is required from
	  the members, although it is encouraged.

  For more information, please see <http://www.openNURBS.org>.

  The openNURBS toolkit uses zlib for mesh and bitmap compression.
  The zlib source code distributed with openNURBS is a subset of what
  is available from zlib.  The zlib code itself has not been modified.
  See ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/zlib/zlib.html for more 
  details.

  Zlib has a generous license that is similar to the one for openNURBS.
  The zlib license shown below was copied from the zlib web page
  ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/zlib/zlib_license.html
  on 20 March 2000.
